### **Postman Workspaces**
- **Purpose**: Designed to organize and collaborate on API-related work.
- **Scope**: A workspace is a container for multiple collections, environments, APIs, and other resources.
- **Collaboration**: Allows team members to work together on shared API projects. Workspaces can be personal, team-specific, or public.
- **Use Case**: Use workspaces to manage separate projects or teams, such as "Development" vs. "Production" APIs.

### **Postman Collections**
- **Purpose**: A structured set of API requests grouped together.
- **Scope**: Collections exist within a workspace and are used to define, document, and test APIs.
- **Organization**: You can add folders, requests, pre-request scripts, and tests to a collection.
- **Use Case**: Use collections to test API endpoints, automate workflows, or share API documentation with others.

### **Key Differences**
| Aspect             | Workspaces                                | Collections                                |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**        | Manages projects and teams.               | Manages specific API requests and workflows. |
| **Scope**          | High-level container for collections, environments, etc. | A focused set of API requests.            |
| **Collaboration**  | Shares resources across teams.            | Shares specific requests or workflows.    |
| **Typical Contents**| Collections, APIs, environments, monitors, and mock servers. | Requests, folders, tests, and scripts.    |

In short, **workspaces organise projects**, while **collections organise API requests**.
